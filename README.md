# NLP API Project

This project is designed to integrate a Natural Language Processing (NLP) API with a frontend React application. The backend is built using Node.js with Express to process text and the frontend uses React to interact with the API.

## Features

- **Backend (Node.js)**: An API that processes text input using an NLP model.
- **Frontend (React)**: A user interface that sends text to the backend and displays processed results.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **NLP Library**: [Compromise](https://github.com/spencermountain/compromise) (or any other NLP library)
- **Database**: None (Currently no database used, but can be added)
